package routes

func Routes() {
	//code for routes should be placed here
	//also controller name can be passed here

	//Exact way of how its working is that:
	//1. Routes called --> Controller const
	//2. Controller call --> Service const
	//3. Service does the requirement things and also call --> DB operation like fetch/update etc and gives the result
}
